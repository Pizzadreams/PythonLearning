# Art Gallery

## Project Description

The Art Gallery app is a simple web application built using Python and the Django framework. The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can view and interact with a collection of artworks sourced from the Unsplash API.

Key Features:
- Django-powered Backend: The app utilizes the Django web framework to handle the server-side logic

- Unsplash API Integration: The app integrates with the Unsplash API to fetch and displays from a collection of high-quality, license-free images for the gallery

### Handling Sensitive Settings
To ensure that your Unsplash API key is not exposed in your Git repository, the app uses a *settings.py* file to store sensitive settings. This file is excluded from the Git repository using the .gitignore file.
