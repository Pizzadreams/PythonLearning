# Iventory Management program (VexIM)

## Develop an inventory management system where you can keep track of available items and their quantities.

### Goals:

  * Data Storage: A dictionary will be created to store inventory items and their quantities.

  *  Adding Items: Functionality will be implemented to allow users to add new items to the inventory. Users will be prompted to enter the item name and quantity, which will be stored in the dictionary.

  *  Removing Items: The program will enable the ability to remove items from the inventory based on user input. Users will be prompted to enter the item name, and if it exists in the dictionary, it will be removed.

  *  Updating Item Quantity: Functionality will be provided to update the quantity of existing items in the inventory. Users will be prompted to enter the item name and the new quantity, and the corresponding value in the dictionary will be updated.

  *  Viewing Inventory: The program will implement a way to display the current inventory to the user. It will print the items in the dictionary along with their quantities.

  *  Error Handling: The program will handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during program execution. For example, it will handle cases where the user tries to remove an item that does not exist or update the quantity of a non-existent item.

  *  User Input Validation: User inputs will be validated to ensure they are in the correct format and within acceptable ranges. For example, the program will validate that the quantity is a positive integer.

  *  Basic Menu System: A simple menu system will be created to allow users to choose different options, such as adding an item, removing an item, updating quantities, or viewing the inventory.

  *  Basic User Interaction: Clear prompts and instructions will be provided to guide users through the program and make the interaction intuitive.

  *  Testing: The program will be tested with various scenarios, including adding items, removing items, updating quantities, and viewing the inventory, to ensure it functions correctly.

  * GUI: Experiment with a GUI toolkit to allow interactivity within the application. Learn about widgets and functions to manage user interface components.
