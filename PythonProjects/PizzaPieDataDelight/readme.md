# Pizza Data Generator using Faker and Pandas
This project aims to generate pizza-related data using the Faker library and organize it with the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is for me to gain a hands-on understanding of data analysis using the Pandas library in Python. By creating and manipulating pizza-related data, I can practice various Pandas operations such as DataFrame creation, sorting, filtering, and exporting data to Excel files.

## Features
- Generates random pizza place names using the Faker library.
- Includes pizza sizes, styles, sauces, toppings, prices, and customer names.
- Exports the generated data to an Excel file using the XlsxWriter library.
- *'pizza_data.xlsx' file will overwrite after every code execution

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data analysis and manipulation library.
- [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/): A library for generating fake data.
- [XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/): A library for creating Excel files.

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas faker XlsxWriter openpyxl
