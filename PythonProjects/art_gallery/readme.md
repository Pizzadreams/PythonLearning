# Art Gallery Project

Welcome to my **Art Gallery** project! This is a web application I'm building using **Python** and **Django** as part of my learning journey.

## About This Project

This app allows users to browse and view artwork images in a gallery format. I’m learning how to handle image uploads, display dynamic content, and structure a Django project effectively.

## What is Django?

Django is a powerful Python web framework that follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** design pattern:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure, usually stored in a database.
- **View:** Handles user requests and returns the appropriate response.
- **Template:** Defines how the data is presented to the user, typically as HTML pages.

## Learning Goals

- Understand Django’s MVT architecture.
- Manage image uploads and display them in a gallery.
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control.
- Improve Python web development skills.
