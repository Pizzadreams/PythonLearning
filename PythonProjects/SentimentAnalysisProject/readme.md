# Sentiment Analysis with BERT Neural Network

This project demonstrates Sentiment Analysis using a BERT-based neural network in Python. The aim of this project is to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of textual content, such as reviews, using a pre-trained BERT model.

## Project Steps

1. **Install and Import Dependencies:**
   - Install PyTorch for deep learning capabilities.
   - Install the Transformers library, which includes pretrained models and tokenizers.
   - Import necessary modules like `bs4` for web scraping, `transformers`, `torch`, `requests`, and `re`.

2. **Setup Model:**
   - Load a pre-trained BERT model using `BertForSequenceClassification` from Transformers.
   - Configure the model for sentiment analysis, adapting it for classification tasks.

3. **Encode and Calculate Sentiment:**
   - Preprocess the textual data and tokenize it using BERT tokenizer.
   - Feed the tokenized data through the BERT model to predict sentiment scores.

4. **Collect Reviews:**
   - Collect textual reviews from a data source, such as websites, APIs, or local files.
   - Use libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` (`bs4`) for web scraping.

5. **Load Reviews into a DataFrame and Score:**
   - Organize the collected reviews and corresponding sentiment scores in a DataFrame.
   - Analyze the sentiment distribution and gain insights from the results.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers requests beautifulsoup4
